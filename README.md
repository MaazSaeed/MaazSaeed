Hiya! I'm Maaz, a Computer Engineering student with a passion for software development, particularly in game development, programming languages, compilers, parsers, operating systems, and math (uhmm is that part of software dev?). In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and solving katas on Codewars, where Iâ€™m ranked 1 kyu (Proficient). I mainly program in C, C++, C#, Lua, Julia, JavaScript, and Scheme and from time to time I go on adventures of learning about other programming languages.
