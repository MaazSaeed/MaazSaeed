Hiya! I'm Maaz, passionate about software development, particularly in _game development, programming languages, compilers, and math_ (is that even part of software dev?). In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and solving katas on Codewars, where Iâ€™m ranked 1 kyu (Proficient). I mainly program in _C, C++, C#, Lua, Julia, JavaScript, and Scheme_. Occasionally, I explore new programming languages for fun.
